# Movies Application

- webpack and json-server with node-sass

## Setup

1. Clone this repo

1. Run `npm install`

1. Run `npm run dev` and visit
   [https://localhost:1313/](https://localhost:1313/) in your browser. Open up
   the console and inspect the output.

Take a look at the `src/index.js` file to get started. You will notice it has
examples of importing and requiring separate javascript files. Regardless of
which you choose to use, you should pick one and use it throughout your code
base, don't mix and match the two.

The file `src/getMovies.js` also contains an example api request. You can
reference this to get started building out the parts of your application that
interact with the api.

The `db.json` file contains your "database". You can edit this file directly to
make changes to your data, and this file will be updated if you make api
requests that modify the data.
