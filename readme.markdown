# Node Project Templates

This repo holds some npm project templates that I like to use.

## Install

1. Clone this repo
2. Put the `create-npm-project` command on your PATH
    - creating a symlink to the command in a directory already on your PATH will
      work to, and is pretty convenient
3. `--help`

```
create-npm-project <template> <destination>
```

The command will create a new directory for you, ready for you to `cd` into,
`npm install`, and start coding!
