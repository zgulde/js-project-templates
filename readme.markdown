# Node Project Templates

This repo holds some npm project templates that I like to use.

The main point of this project is that the templates are ones I've currated, so
I understand (in theory), how everything is wired together. You should probably
use something like `create-react-app` or a similiar command line tool for your
own needs.

## Install

1. Clone this repo
2. Put the `create-npm-project` command on your PATH
    - creating a symlink to the command in a directory already on your PATH will
      work too, and is pretty convenient
3. `--help` to show available templates.

```
create-npm-project <template> <destination>
```

The command will create a new directory for you, ready for you to `cd` into,
`npm install`, and start coding!
